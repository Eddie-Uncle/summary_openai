Hi there, I'm Edson Bernardo dos Santos, and I've been working in the IT industry for so many years now. I am very proud to have known many good people on this journey. It's been interesting.

The idea of the blog is to share knowledge and learn and improve skills, hacks, and everything related to life and career. These are technologies that I have worked with.

My thoughts:

For one, self-criticism. There are literally millions of far better writers than I will ever be. English is not my 1st language, so is my writing sufficiently readable, enjoyable even?

Can I find some original topics to cover, which don’t already have tons of brilliant coverage on other blogs or other mediums? And the list could go on forever…
